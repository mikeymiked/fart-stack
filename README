# The FART Stack
### What is FART Stack?
I recently got laid off from my job as a DevOps Engineer. If you're familiar with the industry, you know that Kubernetes is the "new" and current hotness. Lots of companies expect you to have experience with it and I don't. Right after I was laid off, I purchased a course on Udemy to teach myself Kubernetes. This project was started on Saturday July 16, 2022 and brought to its current state on Sunday July 17, 2022.

The project is simply a website built with Flask, Apache, Redis, and TypeScript. Apache sits in front of Flask directing traffic while Flask pulls its data from Redis and renders a template generated by TypeScript.

### Why TypeScript?
It wouldn't be the FART Stack without it!
