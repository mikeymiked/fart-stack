<h3>What is FART stack?</h3>
I recently got laid off from my job as a DevOps Engineer. If you're familiar with the industry, you know that Kubernetes is the "new" and current hotness. Lots of companies expect you to have experience with it and I don't. Right after I was laid off, I purchased a course on Udemy to teach myself Kubernetes. This project was started on Saturday July 16, 2022 and brought to its current state on Sunday July 17, 2022.<br /><br />

The project is simply a website built with Flask, Apache, Redis, and TypeScript. Apache sits in front of Flask directing traffic while Flask pulls its data from Redis and renders a template generated by TypeScript. All of this has been turned into Docker containers and deployed on a Kubernetes cluster that I built myself, not a Kubernetes cloud service and is accessible to the public via a domain name at https://fart-stack.io<br /><br />
The functionality itself is not impressive, nor is it the point of this project. The impressive part, in my opinion, is going from 0 Kubernetes experience to a complete up and running project deployed on Kubernetes in less than 24 hours.
<h3>What is a tech stack or stack?</h3>
In the tech industry, a "tech stack" or "stack" is simply a list of software/technologies that were used in order to build something.<br />
A popular stack to operate a web server, for example, is called the LAMP stack. All this means is that the server was built/powered by<br />
Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP/Perl/Python.
<h3>Why would/should I use FART stack?</h3>
What a terrific question. The answer is you probably shouldn't. I'm simply a guy in my mid 30s and I still think farts are hilarious.
<h3>What advantages does FART stack provide over other mainstream tech stacks?</h3>
Absolutely none that I can think of.<br /><br />

Here's where the magic happens:

<div style="margin: 20px; padding: 20px; border: 1px solid black; width: 200px" id="root"></div>
<script src="{{ url_for('static', filename='js/app.js') }}"></script>
<h3>How does it work?</h3>
I'm glad you asked. Apache sits in front of an application built in Flask which pulls its data down from Redis while rendering a template powered by TypeScript.
